Genetics in language development

- 25~60% of variance is due to genetics
    - twin studies
    - mostly in regard to grammar more than vocab

- KE family
    - a lot of members had a speech/grammar impairment
    - a lot of other problems 
    - commonality among them seemed to be FOXP2 gene 

- Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) 
    - defined by a language impairment in absence of other impairments
    - 1~5% of population
    - symptoms
        - asynchronies
            - disconnect between sentence length/complexity and lack of morphemes 
        - late onset of talking
        - delay, deficit in use of grammatical morphology
    - possible causes
        - lacking grammar gene 
        - deficit in processing brief/rapidly changing auditory stimuli 
        - poor phonological memory 
        - true cause not known 

- william syndrome (WS)
    - very cognitively impaired EXCEPT for language
    - language is very proper, but not exactly normal 

- DLD and WS is an example of double dissociation
    - not completely doubly dissociated, there's some overlap
        - i.e. the use of low frequency words in WS individuals

- autism 
    - low functioning (LF)
    - high functioning (HF)
        - impaired pragmatics and communicative properties of language
        - spared grammar 


- Deafness 
    - in prelingual deaf infants
        - 10% exposed to sign language from birth
        - 90% exposed to spoken language from birth 

        - pronoun reversal
            - using `you` as I, and `I/me` as you 

        - lip reading can't differentiate between `s` and `z` sounds or `ba` and `ga`
