Morphology and Syntax

- morphenes: smallest unit of meaning 
    - free morphenes: unit of meaning that can exist on its own
    - bound morphenes: unit of meaning that cannot exist on its own
         - only lending meaning when combined with other words (e.g. 's', 'ing')
         - types of bound morphenes:
            - inflectional: does not change the category of the word (e.g. 's', 'd')
            - derivational: 
        - NOTE: when pronouncing the morphene 'ed', there are discrepencies
            - same morphen, different pronounciation
            - walkED -> walk + t
            - draggED -> drag + d
            - plantED -> plant + ed
        - NOTE: English has much simpler morphology compared to other languages

- syntax: discrete combinatorial system
    - theres a finite number of elements (words)
    - combined and permutated to create an infinite number of phrases (sentences)
    - rules of combination are unique to the language 
    - new words and morphenes must be learnt, but new sentences can be understood on the fly

- categories of words
    - open-class (content)
        - nouns
        - verbs 
        - adjectives
    - closed-class (function)
        - determiners (a, an, the)
        - pronouns (this, those, he, she, you)
        - auxiliaries (is, have, can, should)
        - prepositions (off, by, on, below)

- some rules:
    - sentence -> NPVP
    - noun phrase -> (det)(adj)N
    - verb phrase -> V(NP)

    - prescriptive rules
        - dictates form and style
        - (i.e. no prepositions at the end of sentences)
    - descriptive rules
        - dictates meaning and comprehension

    - location of words in the structure matters (in English)
        - languages rich in morphology tend to have more flexible word orders
        - languages poor in morphology tend to have less flexbile word orders
        - what the child needs to learn about morphosyntax varies across languages 
        - ALSO: grouping order in structures change meaning (see slide about bunny with crayon)

    - forming questions can also be done just by switching word locations

- children start to combine words around 18-24months
Q: what do they know about lang structure beyond individual words? How do we know what they know?

A:  - infants can distinguish open vs closed class words at birth
    - how do they do they do this?
    - maybe on the acoustics of the words 
    - STUDY: Shi et al.. 1999
        - stimuli natural tokens of function or content words
        - infants were habituated to one of the 2 lists
        - control group then heard new words from same category
        - experiment group heard new words from other category 
        - used HAS to determine whether or not infant percieved a difference 

Q: what do adults know?
A:
