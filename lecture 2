nature vs nurture for language learning
- nativism
- empiricism 

- how do we study language development?
    - experiment design
        - longitudinally
            - following a group of kids from x age to x+y age
        - cross-sectionally
            - group of x age vs group of x+y age where the first and second groups have no connections
        - observational
            - observe participants in natural environment, no controls
            - observations are restricted to what the participant decides to do
        - correlational
            - observe 2 groups with a relationship between them (kids and their parents)
            - problems: difficult to know why a correlation exists, or if there are environmental factors
            - use a control group to fix this
    - production
        - natural production
            - just observing what participants say/output
        - ellicited production 
            - wug test
        - in general difficult to analyze when subjects are very young
            - babies produce a lot of gibberish
    - comphrehension
        - questions with point/act-out responses to test comphrehension
    - MRI/fMRI
    - computational models
        - model a theory, feed input, compare output with real life output to validate theory

Phonology
- how do we produce speech?
    - for CONSONANTS - by modifying:
        - length of vocal tract
        - location of constriction
            - known as `place of articulation`
            - lips (p, b, f)
            - roof of mouth (t, s, d)
            - back of mouth (h, k g)
        - type of constriction
            - known as `manner of articulation`
            - complete (p, t, k)
            - partial (s, f, z)
            - very little (w, y)
        - vibrating vocal chords
            - known as `voicing`
    - for VOWELS - by modifying:
        - height of tongue
            - close
            - close-mid
            - open-mid
            - open
        - frontness of tongue
            - back
            - central
            - front
        - roundedness of lips 

- how do we talk about speech sounds?
    - different languages use different writing systems
        - some of these systems' spellings don't make phonetic sense (i.e. the sounding of `enough`)
    - solution: international phonetic alphabet (IPA)
    - IPA table is organized by:
        constonants: manner (left hand column), place (top row), voicing (symbols within a box)
        vowels: height, place, rounding
    - english only uses a small subset of total sounds
    - phones: sounds that are acoustically different
        - phonemes: meaningful difference (in relation to the language)
        - allophones: no meaningful difference

- languages differ by:
    - their inventory of sounds (i.e. phones) they use 
    - their division of phones -> phonemes vs allophones (which phones are meaningful)
    - their phonotactics (rules for defining legal sound structures)
        - english allows 8
            - V, CV, VC, [C][C][C][V][C][C][C]
    - prosody
        - pattern of stress and intonation
        - divides languages into 3 rhythmic classes
            - syllabic (syllable timed)
                - defined by fairly equally spaced syllables
            - stress (stress timed)
                - defined by fairly equally spaced stress
            - mora

- contraints of language sounds
    - syllable construction
    - constonant sequencing (phonotatic)
