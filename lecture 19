Bilingualism 

- types of bilingualism 
    - simultaneous
        - when both languages are acquired at birth
    - sequential
        - learning one language first
    - dominant
        - speaker is more dominant in one language 
        - this is not necessarily your first language 
    - balanced
        - speaker uses both languages equally 

- why study bilingualism
    - pratical reasons
        - parent educators want to know the impact on children
    - theoretical reasons
        - test limit of human language capacity
        - understand process of language acquisition 
        - understand role of input in language development 

- brief history
    - 1890 believed bilingualism was a cognitive impediment 
    - 1962 study from McGill was shocked to reveal a cognitive edge for bilingualism
        - coined "bilingual advantage"
        - advantage is in executive functions
            - cognitive inhibition
            - cognitive flexibility
            - shown in young adults, adults, seniors, children 
    - 2013 first article that brought some doubt to the advantage
        - sentiment prior to 2013 mostly due to publication bias
        - studies which did not show an advantage were not published because of a prior belief that the advantage
        should exist
        - differences in cognition may be due to other differences between the studied monolinguals/multilinguals
            - education
            - socioeconomic status
            - culture
            - those who choose to be multilingual vs those who don't 

- 2 games used in experiments
    - middle arrow selectino
    - shape/colour matching

- TAKEAWAY: the bilingual advantage has not been proven beyond doubt
    - still controversial and in debate 

part 2

- how/when do kids know that they are learning 2 different languages as opposed to one unified language
    - 2 hypothesese
        - unitary language system hypothesis
            - could cause language development delay
        - differentiation hypothesis
            - would not cause a language development delay

- STUDY: bilingual and monolingual infants can detect different languages in same rythmic class by 4 months 
    - evidence against unitary hypothesis

- general "results" point towards differentiation
- no notable impediment on language development
