So comprehension data conflicts with production data, whats going on?

- comprehension results may overestimate knowledge
- younger kids may not even understand the question thoroughly
- younger kids may simply be more aware of transitive vs non-transitive
    - older kids may not care as much

- two types of sentences
    - double object: ex. "the woman gave <the man> <a present>"
        - 2 objects at the end of a phrase
    - prepositional phrase: ex. "the woman gave <a present> to <the man>"
        - 2 objects separated by a preposition

- syntactic priming
    - listening to a type of sentence structure influences understanding/production of future structures 
    - i.e. tendency to use the same syntactic frame as sentences heard previously

- STUDY: elicited imitation task
    - children (>3) were primed with a sentence structure
    - then they heard a sample sentence (either with the same structure or changed)
    - then asked to repeat the sample sentence
        - results show that children make mistakes that make the sentence more closely aligned to the primed
        sentences (when given a changed sentence structure)
    - this suggests abstract knowledge, since you need abstract knowledge of sentence structure for this to happen
    
- so for children >3, its pretty clear that they have abstract knowledge
- less clear for children <3

- another example of abstract knowledge is morphology
    - rules of plural/past tense is independent of noun/verb

- children go through 3 phases in regards to past tense production
    - phase 1: past tense production is correct (<2)
    - phase 2: past tense production becomes incorrect (2~4)
        - they add "ed" to all verbs for past tense (overgeneralization)
        - i.e. irregular verb production is incorrect
    - phase 3: past tense production is corrected
Q: whats going on?
A: Theres 2 systems for morphology
    - one based on rules
        - regular verbs
    - one based on memorizations
        - irregular verbs
    - this is supported by the fact that brain damaged individuals have been observed to retain one and not the other

    - phase 1 is based purely on memorization
    - phase 2 is based purely on rules
    - phase 3 is when they learn to appropiately apply both 

Q: How do we learn all this?
A: Its innate
    - poverty of stimuli means that its very unlikely children learn grammar from input alone
    - 

    - what does innate mean?
        - one proposal: principles and parameters (Chompsky)
            - we are born with principles that are valid across all languages
                - ex. sentences are composed of noun phrases and verb phrases
                - NP and VP contain "head" and "complement" component
            - we need to set the parameters that are language specific 
                - ex. in English the head comes before the complement
                - in Japanese, the opposite is true 
    
    - another proposal is that grammar is learned, not innate
        - learning comes by general learning mechanisms
        - i.e. language is learned like all other things

- how do we figure out which is more true?
    - to counter the POS (innate) argument
        - show how general learning mechanisms could lead to grammatical knowledge
        - show input is not impoverished
        - show that input is strongly related to grammatical development
