Categorical perception

- to test older infants (6-12months), we use operant conditioning 
- VOT (voice onset time) ~= voicing

- when we only hear audible changes in "chunks", not smoothly
- seems like babies only notice categorical changes as well
    - specifically english categorical differences (even with non-english born babies) [when it comes to voicing]
        - if the categorical difference is a result of not-voicing (i.e. place) then no alignment with english categories
    - initially thought to mean that humans are born with a specific speech module
    - however further experiments revealed that non-speech sounds are also percieved categorically
        - also applies to visual language stimuli!
        - also applies to non-language stimuli! (i.e. faces)
            - human babies can id different humans (of other races) and different monkeys
            - same with monkey babies
            - this is diminished with age
                - only tested with primates 
    - furthermore, animals also seem to have categorical perception for sounds 

STUDY: Categorical perception in infants
- Eimas (1971)
- done with 1month and 4month olds
- HAS technique to determine whether or not infant heard a change
- 4 groups
    - threshold for category is 30ms
    - group 1 heard 20ms and 40ms voicing 
    - group 2 heard -20ms and 0ms voicing
    - group 3 heard 60ms and 80ms voicing
    - group 4 was a control group

Q: why does age diminish ability to detect changes?
- by end of 1st year, narrowing happens (tuning)
    - infants can no longer hear non-meaningful contrasts
- theory 1: meaning (tuning by semantics)
    - infants learn which sounds are important due to parent's language use
    - i.e. they slowly learn to not care about the auditory differences by using semantic differences 
    - problem: babies develop this tuning before they are able to understand enough semantic differences 
- theory 2: statistical (tuning by distribution)
    - infants track the pattern/distribution of sounds they hear 
        - i.e. how often do what kinds of sounds occur
        - the way researchers came to this theory is by plotting out sound frequency over VOT (look at slides)
        - the peak of this distribution loosely define the categorical cutoff
        - maybe babies percieve this?
    - do infants do this subconciously? is this actually what they are doing?
    - an experiment was done (check slides) that showed a couple minutes of training could re-calibrate a baby's ability
    to perceive categorical differences

        - STUDY: bimodal vs unimodal sound distribution
            - 6~8months
            - bimodal babies continued to be able to hear the difference in voicing
            - unimodal babies could not

    - tens of minutes of training required for human adults
    - this training was purely auditory, but later studies show that socializing the stimuli increases this effect
