Lecture 8

WORD LEARNING

- by 12months, words are treated special
- 3month olds react the same to monkey calls and human speech
- 6months, only words 
    - words are special because they are heard in conversational contexts
    - if tones are used in the same context, they have the same affect on babies

- possible explanations to the gaviguy(?) problem    

- lexical constraints (mentioned in previous lecture?)

- pragmatic assumptions
    - assumptions based on the intentions of the speaker who introduces the new words
    - will take into account the idiosyncracies of the speaker
- mutual exclusivity
- [ignore attention slide]
- cross-situational approach 
    - use data from previous situations
    - essence: what is the most commonly occuring object when a word is heard 
    - babies can do this by 12months 
- language environment usually helps with building these satistics
- speech directed to kids is usually about things in the current space/time
- language cues
    - this is useful a little later (post 1 year)

- these learning methods aren't all speech specific

- trajectory of lexical development
- words are typically mapped to specific contexts (i.e. dog only referring to a specific unique instance of a dog)
- takes time before the word becomes generalized
- question for myself: when do kids differentiate bw the concepts of names/general nouns 

- "birth of a spoken word" found out some predictors for word production
    - frequency
    - easier sentence struct
    - shorter word
    - contextual distinctiveness (words used in this situation are more quickly learned, thus more quickly produced?)
        - these things are factors that influence how early a word is produced

- nouns generally seem to be easier to produce
    - picturable words are easier to learn
    - concreteness is what helps
    - occassions in which verbs are used in the moment is less frequent
    - BUT this is partially specific to English ans its structure
    - sentence-final position (english is SVO) have influence
    - for languages like Korean (SOV), verbs are more easily learned

- incorrect word use
    - could be a comphrehension problem
    - but more often is actually a production problem
