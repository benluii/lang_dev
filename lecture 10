- coincident vs non-coincident items to test whether or not infants could detect prosodic groups
    - the difference between the 2 are placement of pauses
    - this is independent of language, key is that there are pitch and sound changes that suggest an ideal pauses
    placement
    - this applies to music too

- function words come either before or after content words (in most languages)
- turns out theres a correlation between function+content word order and overal word order of the language
- in SVO languages -> function word comes BEFORE content words
- in SOV languages -> function word comes AFTER content words
- since there are acoustic differences between function and content words, this helps them learn the overall
word order

- STUDY: japanese and english infants were familiarized with a string of function-like + content-like words
    - (e.g. the blick the blick the blick the blick ... ...)
    - then asked which word the infant thought came first
    - japanese infants thought the order was "blick the"
    - english infants thought the order was "the blick"
    - methodology was a visual gaze test 
        - i.e. seeing how long an infant looked to the side that played the corresponding order 

- summary:
    - infants have cues to:
        - discriminate function vs content words
            - word order 
        - prosodic groups that correlate to grammatacal grouping

PRODUCTION

- kids seem to learn pairs of words early on
- then learn to combine 2 pairs -> 3 word phrases
- but phrases usually excluded function words
    - known as telegraphic speech
    - i.e. "we go store"
    - why?
        - we know kids know the difference between function and content words
        - but maybe they can't pick them out in fluent speech? NOPE
            - STUDY: 13 month olds were given legit function+content word pairs (the breek, his breek, etc) and
            illegal function+content word pairs (kuh breek, ris breek etc.)
                - turns out they prefer the legit version
                - any younger, and theres no preference 
            - STUDY: 18 month olds can even tell whether or not the function word was the right one
                - i.e. is-ing vs can-ing 
        - maybe producing the complete string is too difficult
            - kids prefer strong words/syllables 
            - this is also mostly for english speaking kids, since function morphenes are not that important
            - not true in other languages (Turkish)
