critical period hypothesis
- special part of brain that atropies over time
- evidence
    - wild child (movie) Genie age 13
    - Danielle age 7
        - some progress (limited vocabulary) made early on, but both regressed soon after 
        - however these aren't controlled experiments, theres a lot of uncontrolled variables that may have otherwise affected them
    - chelsea 
        - diagnosed with mental disability early on
        - everything else was normal
        - diagnosed as deaf at 31
        - language therapy after 31
        - results were strings of words with no grammar
    - deaf children born to speaking parents
        - late acquisition of sign language as first language
        - STUDY: L1 acquisition
            - participants were 35-70 years old who have been using ASL for â‰¥ 30 years
            - acquisition age varied:
                - at birth
                - early (4-6 yrs)
                - late (12 yrs)
            - tested for morphology and syntax (both comphrehension and production)
            - results
                - at birth > early > late
    - STUDY: late vs early L2 acquisition
        - AoA 3-39 years old, been in USA for at least 10 years by testing time 
        - tested for grammar 
        - results were similar 
        - there's a lot of uncontrolled factors tho, namely learning environment of children vs adults
    
    - why does this happen?
    - guesses
        - a specialized biological language component that shuts down after a certain age 
        - the general elasticity of the brain declines with age
            - neural commitments to patterns of first language may inhibit ability to learn new patterns
            - recent study shows that shutting down PirB protein can increase neural plasticity 
        - adult input vs child input differs
        - social-psychological factors of tthe individual learning the language
        - cognitive factors
            - adults use more of a explicit reflective system
            - children use more of a implicit reflexive system
            - tests suggest that explicit reflective learning is good for learning vocabulary
            but worse for learning pronounciation and grammar 

    - summary
        - multiple explanations for why performance drops
        - only certain features of language seem to subject to critical period 
        - cut off seems to be around 7~10
            - hard to make a solid case
            - no standard for what qualifies as "the bar" (i.e. what passes as L1 level)

- pidgin: a simplified version of an exisiting language
- creole: the evolution of a pidgin system into a fully fledged language
- this phenomenon exists in ASL children raised by speaking parents who were poor in ASL 
    - thier ASL skills far exceed the level of input they recieve 
        - Simon and Sarah 
    - was also demonstrated in Nicaragua; the birth of a new language
        - tracked the development of spatial modulations (an aspect of grammar in sign language)
        - cohort 2 (2nd wave of students) seems to build on cohort 1's (1st gen of student's) language with more spatial modulation
            - only with kids aged 6-10
            - >10 did not
