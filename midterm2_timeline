    - infants by age:
        - at birth, can discriminate function vs content words
        - 9 months, can use prosodic bootstrapping
        - 13 months, know valid from invalid function words
        - 18 months
            - know correct from incorrect function word/morpheme relationships
            - can understand word order with known words
        - 21 months, can understand word order with unknown words 
        - 23 months, use function word/morpheme relationships for comphrehension
        - 28 months, can differentiate between transitive and intransitive

        - so from a comphrehension POV, children by 28months pretty much have an abstract idea of verbs and sentence structure
