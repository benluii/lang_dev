interesting phenomenon to lang aquisition 

other species
- they communicate, but is it language?
    - is it referential?
    - intentional?
        - criteria:
            - social use
            - sensitivity to attentional state of recipient
            - manipulation of attentional state of recipient
            - gaze alternation
            - persistence or elaboration (goal directed)
    - combinatorial and creative?

- vervet monkey call system
    - different call dependent on type of predator in thier vicinity
    - referential
        - word-like, but not quite language 
    - not very intentional
        - monkeys do it whether or not there are other monkeys around to warn
    - definitely not very creative 

- chimpanzee gesturing
    - happens in both capitivity and wilderness
    - intentional
        - chimp would stop gesturing once response was receieved 
- chimpanzee vocalizations
    - chimps presented with a fake python either when alone or with group
    - 1 alarm call is unaffected by company
    - 2 alarm calls:
        - were socially directed
        - associated with visual monitoring
        - goal directed 
    - STUDY: sensitivity to attentional state of recipient
        - test chimp would be presented with 2 states:
            - other chimp is resting
            - other chimp is alert
        - when other chimp is alert, test chimp would make less noise
        - when other chimp is at rest, more noise
        - also evidence of persistence
- campbell's monkey 
    - small evidence of a combinatorial group of "words"  

- honey bees
- birdsong development 
- marmoset babbling

- many of these communication systems share characteristics with human language
- but not completely
