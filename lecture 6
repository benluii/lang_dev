Learning Words

- before you know any words, how do you know what is a word?
    - since words are almost always spoken in sentences
    - in written form, words are space deliminated
    - in vocal form, there's no audible delimination 
        - gaps in acoustic do exist, but they don't line up with the word boundaries
        - known as SEGMENTATION PROBLEM

STUDY: segmenting words from fluent speech 
[Jusczyk & Aslin (1995)]
- experiment familiarized babies with a string of words, then played certain words in the sentence vs words not in sentences
- by measuring how long they looked at the side playing the words, one could measure whether or not they recognized the word 
- by 7.5 months, they appeared to notice the word segmentation
    - only with strong-weak syllable stressed words
    - could not recognize weak-strong syllable stressed words 
- not at 6 months, unless
    - the word is preceded by their name
    - experiment was done again with the word always preceded by their name
    - then measured whether or not they recognized the word with the audio test
    - turns out they can! - key is the strong cue as a predecessor 
    - not sure why
        - how did they learn their name as a word? guess is that name is usually spoken in isolation

- 7.5month old quebecois babies have weak-strong syllable bias

- role of phonotactics in word segmentation
    - rare sequences (i.e. n-g, f-h) within english provide good cues for segmenting words (ex. bean-gaffe-hold)
    - doesn't always work (ex. gruff-tove-now)
        - f-t, v-n sequences are quite common, so doesn't provide a good cue to segment words
    - experiment revealed that this was indeed another way babies identified words 

- by 10.5 months babies can segment words with weak-strong, and less phonotactic patterns 

Q: how do babies learn syllable stress patterns? phonotactic patterns?
    - i.e. how did they know f-t, v-n sequences are common if they didn't know what words are?
A: possible answer - some of this is learnt by hearing words in isolation (7% of total words)
