- strong argument: not much weight
- weaker argument: what we'll be examining

- what aspects of language affect thought?
    - vocab
    - grammar
- what aspects of cognition might be affected?
    - categorization
    - memory?
- how deep are these effects?

- potential study populations
    - animals vs people
    - aphasics vs normal people
    - preverbal vs postverbal infants
    - speakers of different languages <- focus

- potentially affected cognition areas

    - colour (lexicon)
        - categorical perception in colour seems to be influenced by colour vocabulary
        - similar to how categorical perception to sounds is influenced by languages 
            - himba people were given a colour test, and had much more difficulty in discerning differences that weren't
            described in their language 

    - spatial relations (lexicon)
        - geocentric 
            - north, south, east, west
            - uphill, downhill, crosshill
        - egocentric 
            - right, left, up, down 
        
        - animal arrangment test
            - subjects arranged the animals in a way consistent with linguistic system of thier language 
            - i.e. Dutch people arranged them egocentrically, Mayans arranged them geocentrically 
            - HOWEVER: Dutch were tested indoors, Mayans were tested outdoors
                - turns out location of test affects the arrangement for Dutch speakers
                - i.e Dutch used geocentric arrangements when outdoors, egocentric when indoors 
            - the affect of language on this cognition area is still in debate

    - gender (grammar)
        - masculine and feminine words
        - different languages have different genders for the same object 
        - memory
            - gender affects memory
            - gender affects description
            - gender affects perception of similarity
