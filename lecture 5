speech perception summary
- at birth
    - sensitivity to prosody
    - categorical perception
    - discrimination of nonnative phonemes
- during first year
    - discrimination becomes lang specific
    - learn the phonotactic regularities of language
    - these developments are largely believed to be influenced by the statistical distribution of sounds they encounter
    during the 8-10 month stage

SPEECH PRODUCTION

early vocal development stages
1) 0-2months - reflexive crying (vegetative sounds)
2) ~2months - cooing (elicited by social interactions)
3) 4-7months - vocal play/expansion (start with back of mouth sounds [k,g], progressing to front of mouth [m,b])
4) 6-9months - reduplicated/canonical babbling (repetition of string syllables, no meaning to sounds)
5) 10-14months - variegated babbling (prosodic contours [jargon], more sounds, still no meaning)

how early are productions tuned to native lang?
- perception to prosody was tuned in utero, is production also tuned in utero?
- tested by observing crying prosody 
    - turns out crying prosody does follow the lang of the mother (i.e. in utero)
    - but babbling (which actually consists of phonemes) starts to tune to native lang around the 6month mark

progression of sound type production
- consistent across cultures, languages, environments, age (even among deaf babies)
    - deaf babies start babbling with hands if exposed to sign lang during the canonical babbling stage
- suggests that this production development is biologically driven 

STUDY: role of social interaction in production 
    - [Goldstein 2003] 
    - 2 groups
        - contigent group
        - yoked group
            - each mom/baby pair in the yoked group was 'yoked' to a mom/baby pair in the contingent group
    - timing of reinforcements was driven by the contingent pair 
    - in other words, babies in both groups received equal amount of stimulation, but one group recieved it in timely
    response to actions, while the other did not
    - contingent babies not only produced more vocoalizations, but thier vocoalizations were more mature 
        - increased rate of syllable production
        - increased rate of canonical syllables
        - more voicing

timeline
- by 12months, both perception and productions have been tuned to native lang
- how does this affect their word productions?

- most of the time, misproductions are due to motor limitations, not perception
- other times, misproductions are due to a preferrence to other sound categories
