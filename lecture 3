Prosody
- syllable stress
- intonation

Rhythmic classes
- syllabic (spanish)
- stress (english)
- mora (japanese)

summary
- sound inventory
    - phonemes vs allophones
- sound arrangement
    - phonotactics, syllable structure
- Prosody
    - stress, intonation, rhythm 
- perception and production

How do we know what babies know?

- theres a specific set of actions that babies exhibit
    - act of sucking
        - high amplitude sucking (HAS)
        - sucking amplitude triggers a sound
        - idea is that babies get bored of same sounds
        - when a new sound is introduced, rate of sucking should go up
        - introduce a new sound and see if rate goes up to see if babies notice change
- experimental procedures rely on:
    - preference for novelty or familiarity 
    - conditioning 

STUDY: Vouloumanos & Werker (2007)    
- are babies born to prefer human speech? (0-2months)
    - presented babies with sine-wave speech vs human speech
    - used HAS to measure babies' eagerness to hear one over another
    - results showed that babies did prefer human speech over sine wave speech
    - another experiment incorporated natural rhesues monkey sounds
        - turns out babies prefer both human and monkey sounds equally over sine wave
        - after 3months, prefered human over monkey 
    - prefers mom's voice over strangers 24hours after birth && 2weeks before birth (using microphone and interval speech)
        - preference measured by heart rate
    - infants can remember stories read during pregnancy
        - infants sucked harder to hear the story they heard in the womb, even when read by a stranger!

How can babies recognize their mom's voice, stories, or native language?

- possible answers
    - segmental (by differentiating b/w individual speech sounds)
    - phonotactics (by recognizing sound structure rules, syllable sequencing)
    - prosodic <- most likely! because sounds in wombs have higher frequencies filtered out, 
    rendering phontactic and segmental artifacts unlikely to be detected
        - seems like babies can only distinguish langauges by prosody
        - i.e. from different rhythmic classes 
        - by 4months babies can distinguish between same rhythmic classes 
    - NOTE: babies can only differentiate prosodic differences, except when it comes to recognizing its mother's voice
        - in regards to its mother's voice, a baby notices more than prosody 

- babies (1-4months) prefer infant directed speech (IDS)
    - specifically the emotionally charged + large pitch change elements of infant directed speech 
    - also true for infant directed sign
        - shows that whats important is emphasis on attention and emotion 
    - other aspects of IDS
        - larger acoustic difference between vowels (i, u, a)
        - slower tempo
        - repetition

what do infants know about 

- adults aren't able to detect continuous changes 
- they can only detect categorical changes
- i.e. when the sound p->b by 10ms voicing increments, adults only hear a difference at the 30ms mark

- babies were tested to
