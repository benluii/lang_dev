stages of communicative development

- stage 1: behaviour has consequences but no intent
    - i.e. burping. crying
- stage 2: attempts to commuincate with intent, but not with language
    - i.e. reaching, looking, pointing 

-joint attention: at around 9months, children are able to focus on an object and a person who's also
looking at that object, at the same time
    - this happens around 2nd stage 
    - children who are better at this have larger vocabularies
- gesturing often precedes words 
    - predicts language development 
    - more meanings in gesturing at 14months predicts larger vocab size later on 
- communication skills in general affect language development 
    - i.e. if a child is very good at non-verbal communications, they tend to also be good at verbal communication 
    - the desire to communicate is what drives the development of language

- understanding implicatures (non-literal meaning of sentences)
    - Grice observed a bunch of conversations
        - came up with a series of maxims
        - these maxims/rules are descriptive:
            - quantity: amount of information
            - quality: truthfulness of information
            - relevance: how related the responses are 
        - the maxims are that people usually provide an appropriate quantity, quality, relevance when engaging in conversation 
    - types of implicatures
        - scalar: the use of weak->strong answers that provide more information than just yes/no 
            - ex. Q: are you done your paper?
                A: I started it.
                - literal answer should be binary -> yes/no
                - non-literal answer provides more information if correct inferences are made 
        - sarcasm: when the meaning is the opposite of the literal words used
            - usually deciphered with tone 
            - STUDY: interpretation of tone/prosody
                - sentences were said with tones consistent with the words, and then again with tones inconsistent with the words
                - adults interpreted sentiment of the sentence on tone alone
                - 10yr olds (half would interpret sentiment on tone/ other half on words)
                - 4yr olds would interpret sentiment on words alone 
        - hyperbole: use of very large words for emphasis
    - adults generate these inferences automatically 
        - i.e. they will assume that "I started it" means "I did not finish it"
            - i.e. any description that is stronger than the given one is not true,
            but technically, all weaker descriptions are true iff the stronger on is true
    - children (up to 5 years old) don't generate these inferences

- STUDY: testing the egocentricity of children
    - common ground: both child and listener could see the same things (2 glasses)
    - privileged ground: child could see more than listener (child sees both, listener only sees 1 glass)
    - children (5 & 6 yr olds) were asked to tell the listener to pick up a glass
        - in the common ground scenarios, they would use desccriptive words to tell the 2 glasses apart
        - in the privileged ground scenarios, they would just say 'glass'
        - same as adults
        - shows that children are sensitive to listeners perspective 

- by age 4, children are pretty good at taking another person's perspective
