Basic properties of the human lang

Formation
- generative?
- recursive 
    - basically sentences are formed on a recursive NounVerbNoun structure
    - where every Noun can be replaced with another NounVerbNoun

Structure (Levels) of language 
- phonology (sounds)
    - what is the set of sounds in the lang
    - how are these sounds put together to form words
    - what aspects of the sounds are important for conveying meaning
- morphology/lexicon (words/ make-up of words)
    - defining units of meaning
    - some units are meaningful on thier own (dog, cat, you, life)
    - some are not (-ing, -ed, -es)
- syntax (sentences)
    - the combination of words to create more complex meaning
    - grammar rules
    - correct syntax != valid meaning

Areas of study
- pragmatics
    - the study of how context contributes meaning to language
- sociolinguistics
    - the study of how society (region, class, gender etc) affects language

How is language learned?
- Skinner
    - language is a behaviour, and is learned like other behaviours
    - i.e. through stimulus, imitation, reinforcement
- Chomsky
    - there is a biological faculty that supports language
    - cannot be simply learned by imitation
        - children produce/understand sentences that they have never heard
        - learning happens much faster than reinforcement occurs
        - stimulus is not that rich
