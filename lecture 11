factors that influence the production of morphemes

- similarity of form
    - e.g. ING always sounds the same 
    - S sounds different depending on which word its attached to (cat-s vs dog-s)
- transparency of function
    - ING only has one meaning
    - S might have more than one meaning
- strength in fluent speech
    - ING has a more prominent sound 

- review of what a kid knows up to this point 
    - year 1
        - early discrimination of function and content words
        - early sensitivity to prosodic word groupings
        - detecting cues to word order
    - year 2 
        - knowledge of function morphemes in perception
        - later in production

- when do they learn about word order?
    - to test pure understanding of syntax alone, tests were done with real world knowledge removed
    - STUDY: testing word order with known words  
        - 16-18 months
        - preferential looking paradigm with videos of the action 
        - test understanding of word ordering 
        - compare 
            - "cookie monster is hugging big bird"
            - "big bird is hugging cookie monster"
    - STUDY: testing word order with words they don't know
        - started testing 25, then 21 month olds 
        - same experiment, using nonsense verbs  
        - 21 months old showed that they understood SVO order, even with missing Subject and nonsense verbs 
    - STUDY: testing word order with different sentence structures 
        - structures:
            - Transitive: ex. John walks Bill
            - Intransitive: ex. John and Bill walks 
        - test both with real and nonsense verbs 
        - by 28months, children can tel the difference between the 2 structures for both real and nonsense verbs 
    
    - studies suggest that by 21 months, children understand how word order affects verbs in general 
    - by 28months, how sentence structure affects verbs in general 

    - a counter STUDY: production based, diary studies with tomasello's child 15-24 months 
        - found that certain verbs were only used with certain nouns
        - i.e. "break" was only used with "Mommy", "Daddy"
        - similar evidence for nouns+function words 
        Q: how do we test for this in produciton?
        A:  familiarity phase: introduce a novel verb with intransitive sentences
                - "this dough is blicking"
            test phase: prompt child with a question 
                - transitive biased question "what are you doing?"
                - expected response "I'm blicking the dough"

        - findings: 
            - >3yo, produced the expected responses
            - <3yo, can only produced familiarized setence structure, i.e. couldn't create the transitive form 

        - Tomasello's proposal
            - children learn about verbs individually
            - no general understanding of verbs 
            - early syntactic knowledge is not abstract, it's item-based 
    
    => comprehension data conflicts with production data
